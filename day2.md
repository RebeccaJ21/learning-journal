# Learning Journal Day 2
Today we learned about arrays, if/else conditionals, Github,and ACP-ing
Worked on my about-me, the Javascript stuff went well, have to work a lot more on css
Have to work on prioritizing time, and not spending so much just thinking of questions. Could always redo that later.
Need to take more time to pay attention to spelling.
