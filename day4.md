#Learning Journal Day 4
##Peer Programining 
*Today we learned about:
  **Functions
  **Peer Programing
  **Various CSS attributes
*Peer Programing was nice because it not only put another pair of eyes on code, to catch errors right away, but also made you think more about the code as you wehre saying it. 
*Still need to work on Arrays and for/while loops
*Writing Functions at this point was fairly simple
*Learned about NaN functions
